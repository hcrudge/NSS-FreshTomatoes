**Setup: Follow the steps below:**

1. Use terminal to clone this repository - 
1. cd into the directory it creates
``git clone git@github.com:hcrudge/NSS-FreshTomatoes.git
cd fresh-tomatoes``

1. Create an api directory outside of the project directory.
2. You will need to request an API Key from The Movie Database (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)
3. In the api directory, create a copy of the database.json.example and remove the .example extension.
4. Run json-server -p 8088 -w database.json from the api directory.
5. Run npm install and wait for all dependencies to be installed.
6. Run npm start to verify that installation was successful.


>Note: Your database.json file is already in the .gitignore file for this project, so it will never be added to the repo or pushed to Github.


I decided to create Fresh Tomatoes because I love to spend time watching good movies, but there are so many options out there, and not all of them are worth my time to watch (for me). I have lovely friends and family who recommend films, but I have found that often I couldn't remember the name of a movie they recommended, or I would remember the name, but couldn't remember who recommended it to me, so I could tell if I really wanted to watch that or was in the mood for the type of film they generally enjoyed.

I was frustrated with available list applications and their lack of features for keeping track of these recommendations, so I built my app to keep track of a users list of movies recommended by friends, as well as their ratings of these movies once they had watched them. 

My goals for this app were to build a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app to help solidify and expand my understanding and comfort with coding in React and Javascript as well as utilizing a third party API and dabbling in the Bulma CSS framework (and a few other plug-in components).  
I also utilized GitHubâ€™s project board to help keep myself organized and on task.

This application is built for my Front-End/Client-Side Capstone project for Nashville Software School.

**Tech Stack:

The app is built with the ReactJS library and supplemented with The Movie DataBase API, react-star-rating npm, Fresh Tomatoes is designed as a CRUD app and is supported by a flat data-structure utilizing JSON Server along with being styled with Bulma framework and CSS.

API Resources:
The following are examples of how your JSON server should look once it is populated with data from the application.

Note: This version of Fresh Tomatoes has mock authentication and does not provide secure storage. Please do not store sensitive information in this database!
